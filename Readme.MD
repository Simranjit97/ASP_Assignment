I made this project to keep track of songs that I have. This Project consists of 2 Tables named Artists and Songs. This has been done using Visual Studio 2017 and this is a ASP.NET Framework Project (MVC).
This is Assignment 1 of my "Server-Side Scripting -ASP.NET" course.

I have changed the css for the Interface to look better.
And also added functionality to --ASP.NET Identity-- as a advanced feature. You need to login to view and make changes to Artists and Songs.
